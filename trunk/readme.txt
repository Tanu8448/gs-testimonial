== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add new Testimonial? =
Testimonial post type will show below POSTS. To add new testimonial, go to Testimonial > Add New, then add Testimonial Author name at Title, Full testimonial at Editor, Author Image, Company Name & Designation at respective fields and Finally Publish.

= What will be the Author image dimension? =
Better to add square size image. Default image size set to 86px X 86px.

= How to use shortcode inside page templates? =
WordPress has a great function, do_shortcode(), that will allow you to use shortcodes inside your theme files. For example, to output Testimonials in a Theme file, you would do this: ```<?php echo do_shortcode('[gs_testimonial'); ?>```
